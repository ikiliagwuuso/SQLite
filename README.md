Building API

API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. In other words, an API is the messenger that delivers your request to the provider that you're requesting it from and then delivers the response back to you

The API was built using Flask application and tested on Postman for http errors.
The application was built using Flask, index.html and app.py and it communicates with the server when a GET or POST request is sent on Postman where the DNS and localhost request 127.0.0.1 sends a server request. The port forwarding is set.
